Run the Crawler.exe file to play the game.

Feel free to mod if you can in the information folder, but you'll have to figure out how.

There is a secret terminal in the game, the password of which you can get by defeating Knight Sylect.

I implore you to use the backup folder. Whenever you beat a dungeon or get an item or level up, copy your
char.dat file and paste it in to the backups folder.

When you open the exe, it'll take a second. Just let it load.
